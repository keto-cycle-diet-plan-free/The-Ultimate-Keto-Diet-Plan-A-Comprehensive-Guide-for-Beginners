## What is a Keto Diet?
A ketogenic diet is a high-fat, moderate-protein, and low-carbohydrate diet that shifts the body's metabolism into a state of ketosis. In ketosis, the body burns fat for fuel instead of carbohydrates.

## How Does the Keto Diet Work?
Ketosis occurs when carbohydrate intake is drastically reduced, prompting the body to use stored fat as its primary energy source. The liver converts fat into ketones, which are then used by the body for energy.

## Benefits of a Keto Diet
- **Weight Loss**: Helps reduce body fat efficiently.
- **Improved Mental Clarity**: Ketones provide a stable energy source for the brain.
- **Better Blood Sugar Control**: Beneficial for individuals with type 2 diabetes.

- **Reduced Inflammation**: May help with chronic conditions.

## Types of Keto Diets
- **Standard Keto Diet (SKD)**: 70-80% fat, 20-25% protein, 5-10% carbs.
